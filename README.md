# DNS Delgation TOOL:
Developed a Python Script to let people understand how the delegation works in a DNS Flow starting from the Root Server all the way to the Name Server where the Final Records of the domain name is hosted. 
The tool lists all the A, CNAME and NS Records delegated in the name server and further can be implemented to display all the Records.

# Before Using the Tool:
pip install dnspython
